            <p>Hey there! this is Akshay Vashistha. I am currently a final year B.Tech student from Department of Information Technology @JSSATE, Noida. I was a Google Summer Of Code 2017 student for the umbrella organisation CERN. I was a member of Deep Learning team there where I developed a DNN library with two other guys. My work is integrated in TMVA(Toolkit for Multi Variate Analysis) which is used by CERN to make predictions and analysis on the particle physics data mainly from LHC. I was working with experimental physicists there, they mentored me directly and it was great to work with them. The 4 months period of GSOC made me learn a lot of things. Its great to get recognized as a GSOC student. Not only its a good stipend but also you have an all over growth. You connect with students all over, discuss different ideas and approaches and create something which will help the open-source organisations. I would recommend all of you to definitely give it a shot for next year Google Summer Of Code event. We were 4 of JSS this year who got selected for this programme and now we have great expectations from you guys to increase the number in coming years. If you have any doubts regarding the same just catch me anywhere in the campus or on social media, I will be happy to help. </p>
